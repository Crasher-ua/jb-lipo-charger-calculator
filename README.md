# JB Li-Po Calculator

Joshua Bardwell made another wonderful video for FPV community called "Is your lipo charger too big? Could you be charging faster?". It included a link to sheet which makes a useful calculation to understand your Li-Po charging limitation. I've thought that making manual download of file and changing the values in it is quite boring and recreated a same logic on this GitHub page. The numbers are slightly different due to another numbers rounding, but overall they are same and represent same stuff.

Please let me know if something should be changed.
